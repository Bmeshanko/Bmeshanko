Hello, I’m Ben Meshanko! I am a Computer Science Student at Purdue University! I am originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Go Steelers!). I am a huge Java nerd, I love reading through Oracle's documentation about various classes that are pre-implemented.
- I’m currently learning about Fundamental Data Structures and their applications.
  - I’m looking to collaborate on several projects relevant to this.

Reach me by email at bmeshank@purdue.edu.
