Hello, Iâ€™m Ben Meshanko! I am a Computer Science Student at Purdue University. I am interested in Music, Chess, Data and Science.

I am originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Go Steelers!). I am a huge Java nerd; I love reading through Oracle's documentation about various classes that are pre-implemented.

- Currently learning about Fundamental Data Structures and their applications.
  - I am looking to collaborate on several projects relevant to this.

- Working on a Poker Simulation to determine the best way to play.

- Looking to start a new long-term project to stretch my limits. 

Reach me by email at bmeshank@purdue.edu.
